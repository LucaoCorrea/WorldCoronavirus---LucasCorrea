                COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchersand policymakers to seek public health measures to
                prevent
                the collapse of health systems and reduce deaths.
                This narrative review sought to summarize the evidence on the impact of social distancing in the
                course
                of the COVID-19 epidemic and to discuss its implementation in Brazil.
                We searched papers describing the effects of social distancing on COVID-19 in PubMed, medRXiv and
                bioRvix databases.
                Federal and stateslegislation were analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Brazil.
                This review suggests that social distancing in the entire population is effective, especially when
                combined with the isolation of cases and the quarantine of contacts.
                We recommend the implementation of social distancing, and social protection policies to ensure the
                sustainability of these strategies.
                For the control of COVID-19 in Brazil, it is essential that these measures are combined with the
                strengthening of the epidemiological monitoringin the three levels of SUS, which include the
                evaluation
                and use of additional
                indicators to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic and the effect of control measures, the
                expansion of
                testing capacity,
                and the wide and transparent availability of disaggregated case and testing registries.
                COVID-19 pandemic has challengstries.

                <p>SOCIAL DISTANCE</p>
                Keep a safe distance from other people (at least 1 meter), even if they don't look sick.
                Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
                Prefer open, well-ventilated areas rather than indoors. Open a window if you are indoors.
                Clean your hands often. Use soap and water or alcohol gel.
                Get the vaccine when it's your turn. Follow local guidelines for this.
                Cover your nose and mouth with your bent arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
                Stay home if you feel unwell.

                Non-pharmacological measures include personal protection measures, environmental measures, social
                distancing measures and measures related to international transit. While historically the adoption of
                these measures has been integrated into preparedness plans to respond to pandemic flu, they are
                currently being applied worldwide to combat the spread of COVID-19. The considerations presented in this
                document refer to social distancing measures and measures related to international transit, which are
                closely linked. 2. The public health reasons that justify the adoption of social distancing measures are
                related to minimizing the possibilities of exposure to people infected with the SARS-COV-2 virus, which
                causes COVID-19, which reduces the number of cases, including of deaths; reduces the burden on health
                services, so as not to exceed their capacity and thus avoid an even greater public health crisis; and
                flattens the epidemic curve, to buy time until specific pharmacological measures are available (eg,
                specific effective treatment for COVID-19 or vaccines).

                Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save
                lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against
                COVID-19.

                If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as
                physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your
                hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
